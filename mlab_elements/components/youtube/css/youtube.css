What License Is Code I Post to CodePen?
In short: public Pens are MIT Licensed, private Pens are owned by you with no implicit license. Read on for more detail.

If your Pen is public...
By default, Pens you save on CodePen are public. PRO accounts have the ability to save as private, so for information on that jump down to the next section. Public pens are automatically MIT licensed. We apply it by putting it into the HTML source when the pen is viewed in its "Full Page" view. But the license applies to the Pen itself, wherever it is viewed. Here is that license:

The gist of it is open source. Anyone can use the code you put on CodePen for whatever they wish - but if they do - that code also must have this same license. This is to encourage open sharing of code. Remember that any code you post on CodePen should be compatible with this license or it is subject to removal.

If your Pen is private...

We don't put any license at all on the code. It belongs entirely to you. You may still apply a license to it if you wish. To do that, we recommend putting an HTML comment into the HTML of your Pen stating the license. Remember that private Pens are still shareable if you wish. So you could, for example, send a client a private Pen of a mockup you have done for them, and that code is still owned by you. They couldn't just take it and use it like they could if it was MIT licensed.
