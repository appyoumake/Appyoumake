**onMlabReady**()

Runs when mlab object has been set up. Loops through the globally defined arrays "mlab_initialiseApp" and "mlab_initialiseComponent", and calls the functions registered in these. In the spec, mlab_initialiseApp and mlab_initialiseComponent are defined as single functions. However, most apps and pages have more than one component. If they all implement functions of the same name in the global namespace, only the latest added will be run. So instead, we store the component's init methods in two global arrays, and loop through these, to make sure everything gets set up properly.
